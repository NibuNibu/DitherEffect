**Installation**
Download the whole folder and through python run *main.py*.

**What you can do:**
You can input any *.jpg, *.png, *.bmp image and apply dither effect on it. You can also choose if you want aberration or not.

**What you can't do (for now):**
You can't export the image.

**Planned updates:**
- Exporting images.
- More dither effects.
- Better color picking (some kind of cosine gradient).
- More aberration options.
